# docker-silex

This is a simple project written in [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), running on [Docker](http://www.docker.com/). It features two classic getting started examples - Hello, World! and Fizzbuzz. See the [endpoint examples](#Endpoints) for more details.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) which is included with Docker on Mac and Windows systems. Other systems please refer to the Docker Compose install docs.

## Usage

```
